# Bygone Nether
> To advance the ancient history of the nether dimension.

Herein lies my changelog and motivation for developing a mod for Minecraft aiming to advance the lore behind the nether dimension, as well as provide additional challenges and compelling gameplay in the survival game mode.

<hr/>

## üß† Motivation

Modifications and additions to Nether structure spawning offer wide potential to introduce new lore implications. The additions should backlight the Piglin vs. Wither war, the ancient activities of these species, and expand upon the workings of their civilizations.

The gameplay should include additional and unique challenges which offer unique but rewarding loot. There should be additional purpose to explore each vanilla nether biome.

The new mobs should provide novel combat and cooperation. The designs should be deliberate and thorough to make the world feel lived in, and should reinforce the intended lore and magic system. The treasures to be gained from these endeavors should be upgrades to current vanilla offerings.

The structures should be as procedural as possible so that few many spawns play the same. The loot should be balanced enough to encourage exploration, but to not break the game's progresion.

## üìñ Current Features
